= Kana Gemu

A little toy project to play around with vanilla JavaScript and see if a game
helps with learning Japanese kana.
It's somewhat usable already, although ugly and not feature complete.

If you don't want to bother checking out the project, you can just use the
https://anpanator.github.io/kanaGemu[GitHub page].
